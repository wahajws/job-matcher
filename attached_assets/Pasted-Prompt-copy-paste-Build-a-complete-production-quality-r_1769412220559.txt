Prompt (copy/paste)

Build a complete, production-quality, responsive ReactJS frontend for a “CV → Job Matching” web app. Frontend only (no real backend). I’m using Replit, so it must run immediately after install. Use React + TypeScript + Vite. Use MUI (Material UI) for UI components and responsiveness. Use React Router for routing. Use TanStack Query (React Query) for data fetching with mocked APIs. Use Zustand for global state (auth/user role + UI state). Use React Hook Form + Zod for forms and validation. Provide clean folder structure and reusable components.

App concept

The app ingests CV PDFs (admin bulk upload + candidate upload), shows extracted “Matrix” created by Qwen (simulated), then matches candidates to job postings with a score and explanation. Also supports location filtering using phone country code (simulated).

Roles

Implement two roles with a simple role switcher (no real auth):

Admin

Candidate
Store role in Zustand and persist in localStorage.

1) Must-have pages / routes

Use React Router with these routes:

Public/common

/login (fake login page)

Select role (Admin/Candidate) + name + email

“Continue” sets role state and routes accordingly

/ redirect:

Admin → /admin/dashboard

Candidate → /candidate/dashboard

Admin routes

/admin/dashboard

KPI cards (mock counts): total CVs, processed, needs review, jobs, matches generated

Recent uploads table

Recent jobs table

/admin/cvs

CV list table with filters: status (Uploaded/Parsing/Matrix Ready/Failed/Needs Review), country, tags, score threshold (optional)

Search by name/email/skill keyword

Row click opens CV detail drawer or navigates to /admin/cvs/:id

/admin/cvs/upload

Bulk upload UI:

Drag-and-drop multi-file PDF upload

Show per-file progress (mocked)

Batch tag input (e.g., “Jan 2026 Batch”)

Dedup simulation: show warning if filename duplicates

Show an “Ingestion Report” after upload with success/failed

/admin/cvs/:id

Candidate profile header (name, email, phone, inferred country)

Tabs:

“Matrix” (structured matrix JSON rendered nicely)

“Evidence” (highlighted snippets)

“Matches” (job list with score + view details)

“Notes” (admin notes + tags + status)

/admin/jobs

Jobs list with status (Draft/Published/Closed), location type, country/city

Create job button → /admin/jobs/new

/admin/jobs/new

Job creation form:

Title, Department, Location type (Onsite/Hybrid/Remote), Country, City

Job description text area

Must-have skills chips input

Nice-to-have skills chips input

Min years experience, seniority level

Publish toggle

On submit: create mock job and auto-generate “Job Matrix” (simulated Qwen output) and navigate to /admin/jobs/:id

/admin/jobs/:id

Job header + job matrix panel

Ranked candidates table:

Candidate name, country, score, breakdown mini-bars, status (shortlisted/rejected)

Filters:

Country filter

Minimum score slider

Must-have skill filter (multi-select)

Candidate row click opens a right-side drawer:

score explanation

matching breakdown

gaps (missing skills)

actions: shortlist / reject / add note

/admin/settings

Theme toggle (light/dark)

“Mock mode” notice

Prompt/model metadata fields (read-only): “Qwen model: latest” (display only)

Candidate routes

/candidate/dashboard

Upload CV card (single PDF)

“My Matrix” card (if available)

Recommended jobs list with scores

/candidate/profile

Profile form: name, email, phone, country (editable), headline

“Re-run matching (mock)” button

/candidate/jobs

Job list with filter by location type, country

Job detail drawer with “Why I match” explanation

/candidate/jobs/:id

Full job description + your match score + gaps + apply button (mock)

2) UI/UX requirements

Make it modern, clean, enterprise-like.

Fully responsive:

Mobile: stacked cards, drawers become full-screen

Desktop: tables + side drawers

Use MUI App Bar + responsive sidebar navigation:

Admin menu: Dashboard, CVs, Upload CVs, Jobs, Settings

Candidate menu: Dashboard, Jobs, Profile

Use consistent design tokens and spacing.

Provide loading skeletons, empty states, and error states.

3) Data model (frontend types)

Create TypeScript types for:

User, Role

Candidate, CvFile, CvStatus

CandidateMatrix (skills array, roles, years, domains, education, languages, locationSignals, confidence, evidence[])

Job, JobStatus, JobMatrix

MatchResult (score 0-100, breakdown, explanation, gaps)

AdminNote, Tag

4) Mock API layer (no backend)

Create /src/api/ with functions that return Promises + simulate latency:

login()

listCandidates(), getCandidate(id), uploadCvs(files, batchTag)

listJobs(), createJob(), getJob(id)

getMatchesForJob(jobId), getMatchesForCandidate(candidateId)

shortlistCandidate(jobId, candidateId), rejectCandidate(...), addNote(...)

Simulate “processing pipeline”:

After upload, CV status goes Uploaded → Parsing → Matrix Ready with timed transitions.

Generate matrices and match scores deterministically from seeded randomness (so UI is stable).

Use TanStack Query for fetching and caching. Provide query keys.

5) Components to build (reusable)

AppLayout with sidebar + topbar

DataTable wrapper (MUI Table) with sorting + pagination (client-side)

FileDropzone for PDF upload (drag/drop)

ScoreBadge (0–100) + color mapping

BreakdownBar (skills/experience/domain/location)

MatrixView (pretty rendering of matrix sections)

EvidenceList with “copy snippet”

StatusChip

FilterBar components

RightDrawer for detail panels

ConfirmDialog for reject/shortlist

Toast notifications (MUI Snackbar)

6) Deliverables

Output all necessary files with a clear project tree, including:

package.json with dependencies

vite.config.ts

src/main.tsx, src/App.tsx

src/routes/*

src/pages/* for all pages

src/components/*

src/api/*

src/store/* (Zustand)

src/theme/*

src/types/*

src/utils/* (phone country code parsing helper, seeded random helper)
Include instructions to run in Replit:

install

run dev

Do NOT implement any backend. Do NOT include server code. Keep API calls mocked.

Also, ensure the UI copy references: “Matrix generated by Qwen (latest)” as a label in relevant places (candidate matrix view and job matrix view).
