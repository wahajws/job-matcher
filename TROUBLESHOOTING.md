# Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Server Issues

### 1. MySQL Error: "Too many keys specified; max 64 keys allowed"

**Error:**
```
ER_TOO_MANY_KEYS: Too many keys specified; max 64 keys allowed
```

**Cause:**
This happens when the `users` table (or other tables) has accumulated too many indexes, often from repeated migration attempts with `alter: true`.

**Solutions:**

#### Option A: Check and Fix Indexes (Recommended)
```bash
# Check current indexes
npm run db:fix-indexes

# This will show you duplicate indexes and provide SQL commands to remove them
```

#### Option B: Skip Migration (If tables already exist)
```bash
# Set environment variable to skip migrations
export AUTO_MIGRATE=false
# Or in .env file:
AUTO_MIGRATE=false
```

#### Option C: Force Recreate Tables (⚠️ Deletes all data!)
```bash
# Only use in development or if you can lose data
export FORCE_RECREATE_TABLES=true
npm run db:migrate
```

#### Option D: Manual Index Cleanup
Connect to MySQL and check indexes:
```sql
-- Check all indexes on users table
SHOW INDEXES FROM users;

-- Remove duplicate indexes (replace 'index_name' with actual name)
DROP INDEX `index_name` ON `users`;
```

**Prevention:**
The migration script has been updated to avoid this issue by:
- Using `alter: false` by default (safer)
- Catching "too many keys" errors and skipping alter operations
- Only creating tables if they don't exist

### 2. Port Already in Use (EADDRINUSE)

**Error:**
```
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use 127.0.0.1:5000
```

**Cause:**
Another process is already using port 5000, or PM2 is trying to start multiple instances.

**Quick Fix (Recommended):**

```bash
# 1. Stop all PM2 processes
pm2 delete all

# 2. Check and kill any process using port 5000
npm run port:check
# If processes found, kill them:
npm run port:kill

# 3. Verify nothing is using the port
npm run port:check

# 4. Start fresh
npm run pm2:start:dev
```

**Detailed Solutions:**

#### Step 1: Check What's Using Port 5000
```bash
# Use the helper script
npm run port:check

# Or manually (Linux)
sudo lsof -i :5000
# Or
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep 5000

# Find the process ID (PID) and kill it
sudo kill -9 <PID>
```

#### Step 2: Stop Only This App (Safer - Recommended)
```bash
# Check what PM2 processes are running
pm2 list

# Stop only this app (safer - won't affect other apps)
pm2 stop asset-manager-dev
pm2 stop asset-manager

# Delete only this app's processes
pm2 delete asset-manager-dev
pm2 delete asset-manager

# Or delete by ID if you see multiple instances
pm2 delete <id>
```

**⚠️ WARNING:** If you have other apps running on PM2, use the commands above instead of `pm2 delete all` which will stop ALL PM2 processes.

#### Step 2b: Stop All PM2 Processes (Use Only If No Other Apps)
```bash
# ⚠️ ONLY use this if you have NO other apps on PM2
# This will stop ALL PM2 processes on the server

# Stop all PM2 processes
pm2 stop all

# Delete all PM2 processes
pm2 delete all
```

#### Step 3: Check PM2 Status
```bash
# List all PM2 processes
pm2 list

# If you see multiple instances, delete duplicates
pm2 delete <app-name>:<id>
```

#### Step 4: Kill Processes Using Port (Automated)
```bash
# Use the helper script to automatically find and kill
npm run port:kill

# Or manually kill specific PID
sudo kill -9 <PID>
```

#### Step 5: Change Port (Alternative)
If you can't free port 5000, change it in your `.env`:
```env
PORT=3000
```

Then restart:
```bash
pm2 restart asset-manager
```

#### Step 6: Restart Cleanly
```bash
# Make sure no processes are running
pm2 list
npm run port:check

# Start fresh (only ONE of these)
npm run pm2:start:dev    # For development
# OR
npm run pm2:start        # For production

# Don't run both at the same time!
```

### 3. Database Connection Issues

**Error:**
```
Database connection failed
```

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Database Credentials:**
   ```bash
   # Verify .env file has correct DATABASE_URL
   cat .env | grep DATABASE_URL
   ```

2. **Test Connection:**
   ```bash
   # Test database connection
   npm run db:verify
   ```

3. **Check Database Server:**
   ```bash
   # Check if MySQL is running
   sudo systemctl status mysql
   # Or
   sudo service mysql status
   ```

4. **Create Database if Missing:**
   ```bash
   npm run db:create
   ```

### 4. PM2 App Keeps Restarting

**Symptoms:**
- App shows as "errored" or keeps restarting
- High restart count in `pm2 list`

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Logs:**
   ```bash
   pm2 logs asset-manager --err
   ```

2. **Check Memory:**
   ```bash
   pm2 monit
   # Look for memory usage
   ```

3. **Increase Memory Limit:**
   Edit `ecosystem.config.cjs`:
   ```javascript
   max_memory_restart: '2G', // Increase from 1G
   ```

4. **Check for Errors:**
   ```bash
   # View recent errors
   pm2 logs asset-manager --lines 100 --err
   ```

### 5. Migration Fails During Startup

**Error:**
```
Database initialization failed: Error: Command failed: npm run db:migrate
```

**Solutions:**

1. **Skip Auto-Migration:**
   ```bash
   # In .env file
   AUTO_MIGRATE=false
   ```

2. **Run Migration Manually:**
   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate
   ```

3. **Fix Index Issues First:**
   ```bash
   npm run db:fix-indexes
   ```

---

### 6. PM2 Not Starting on Server Reboot

**Solutions:**

1. **Re-run Startup Script:**
   ```bash
   pm2 startup
   # Follow the instructions (usually requires sudo)
   ```

2. **Save PM2 Configuration:**
   ```bash
   pm2 save
   ```

3. **Verify Startup Script:**
   ```bash
   # Check if startup script exists
   pm2 startup
   ```

---

## Quick Fix Commands

```bash
# Stop everything and start fresh
pm2 delete all
pm2 stop all
npm run pm2:start

# Check what's wrong
pm2 logs asset-manager --err
pm2 monit

# Fix database issues
npm run db:fix-indexes
AUTO_MIGRATE=false npm run pm2:start

# Change port if needed
PORT=3000 npm run pm2:start
```

---

## Getting Help

1. **Check Logs:**
   ```bash
   pm2 logs asset-manager --lines 200
   ```

2. **Check PM2 Status:**
   ```bash
   pm2 list
   pm2 show asset-manager
   ```

3. **Check Database:**
   ```bash
   npm run db:verify
   ```

4. **Check Environment:**
   ```bash
   # Verify .env file exists and has correct values
   cat .env
   ```

---

## Prevention Tips

1. **Always use `alter: false` in migrations** (already fixed in code)
2. **Don't run migrations multiple times** without checking table state
3. **Use PM2 properly** - don't start multiple instances manually
4. **Monitor logs regularly** to catch issues early
5. **Backup database** before running migrations in production
